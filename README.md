# To-Do List App

A simple and interactive to-do list application built with **JavaScript**, based strongly on the [CSSnippets tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRkaen6MeQc). 

Currently includes a few minor changes, with more improvements planned!

Here are some ideas and improvements planned for future updates:

- [ ] Support for multiple **to-do lists** (e.g. "Work", "Groceries", "Projects")
- [ ] **Dark mode** toggle
- [ ] Save tasks to **localStorage** (multiple)

Feel free to contribute or fork the project if you'd like to help build any of these features!
